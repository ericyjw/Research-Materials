Prediction of Enemy Course of Action (Direction)
	- Supervised Learning using DNN


Optimization of Resource Allocation (Asset Allocation)
	- Operation Research / Dynamic Programming
	- Reinforcement Learning
	- Genetics Algorithm


Strategic Decision
	- find simulator/code for playing out strategic decisions using computational game theory (best if military related)

	
Environment (Enemy Deployment)
	- openAI gym?
        - unity3D (might be too complex) 
        - look for others. can be non graphical  (any chessboard like one?)
    
        - for computational game theory testing (fill in own reward first) 
             - reference: pluribus or libratus, counterfactual regret minimization


May
------
wk3: determine environment + determine outcome of internship
        - chessboard like environment
        - environment for trading (for learning) 
     look for example codes for computational game theory
        - poker
